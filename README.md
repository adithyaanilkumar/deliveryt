# What is HomeBrew?

HomeBrew is cross platform community driven marketplace to empower home makers and daily wage workers by providing them with E-commerce,Logistics and an additional source of income.HomeBrew helps customers get good quality home made food right from the comfort of their homes and allows homechefs and daily wage workers to earn an additional source of income.

HomeBrew is a hyperlocal E- commerce platform for buying and selling Home made items. It allows for Home-makers, Artists, Pastry Chefs, Craftsman to display their products online and sell them.Since it is a hyper local delivery service, it is possible for Home chefs to deliver these items to the buyers.

# Why HomeBrew was started ?

Good food is one of the essential items for people‚Äôs healthy daily living or otherwise. It is always hard for young professionals, office goers, boarders to have good home-cooked food unless they start preparing for themselves. For these segments of people, good home cooked food is most of the distant reach. Hence there is an enormous potential in this category of business, especially since Home cooks lack a proper online platform to sell, connect and share as a community. Earnings of Rickshaw drivers are adversely affected due to travel restrictions and surge of fuel prices. Even if 10% of the $378 million home chef market is tapped it can give gross revenue of $37.8 million annually for ‚Äúhome chef‚Äù in this market segment. 

# The Vision

Upon joining as a member on the site, the users can enter their address and create their profile. It provides an easy-to-use interface for the registered users to browse various kitchens of homecooks and add home made food from these kitchens to their carts.This makes their lives easier as they can get delicious home made food delivered right to their doorstep.The users can track the live delivery details and also provide ratings to the home chefs food that they received.The delivery is undertaken by Auto-Rickshaw drivers through an app that is available to them.The Homechefs have access to an admin dashboard where they can upload details of the food that they are selling and can also see the order details and manage inventory.
